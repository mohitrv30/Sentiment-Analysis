ever received. seen 7; seven different doctors regarding knee problem also included emergency room visit panorama city hospital still nothing solved! unable walk, bend knee, lay sleep, work, move without assistance crutches wheelchair, etc. toyed around ** promises would get callback schedule appointments see doctor specialized, yet get follow-up phone calls specialized doctors. last doctor seen not order tests (like mri instance) done, refuse it. kaiser permanente not use years ago. doctors leave waiting room forever without checking you. frustrating wait hour doctor spends 5 mins. southwood, panola road worst. looking clinic kaiser you. looking great service, avoid kaiser!!! kaiser nightmare. costing $500 month making appointments hardest doctors worst dont listen patients make fun health concerns. denied getting appointments multiple times first 2 months signed even though pay $500 month. internal scam operations kaiser claim not appointments eliminate services front. doctors worst ever experienced dont help. make things worse worse. not even sure still business. steal innocent patients money refuse provide valuable service. never go again. recently bad experience

call told date. paid several times via web. one bill receive, dec. believe, paid phone, got one day due. got notice late. went online paid again. ive kaiser permanente many years husbands employer. give mediocre review following reasons -- 1) inconsistent quality doctors (after complaining fatigue, primary dr said due age, bs; also laughed broke foot; strange; another time diagnosed pneumonia, turned kidney infection); 2) big problem drive across town go approved hospital; 3) factory model medicine -- got tired feeling like assembly line. positive aspects include: advanced care center -- miniature er go anytime; also able call advice nurse anytime. besides ridiculous costs prescriptions impossibilities getting appointments, tried 3 months get explanation benefits 4th qtr 2015. hard be??? not keep records? beyond frustrated. tore rotator cuff last june. waited 2 months going doctor 3 shoulder surgeries recovery time minimum two years. hoping wasnt torn would heal. went primary care physician (a doc kaisers payroll) august radiograph done would not order mri. told see orthopaedics doctor get mri. finally got appointment end september orthopaedics surgeon agreed rotator cuff probably torn. severe closed head injury child acquired claustrophobic anxiety disorder result. explained physician needed open mri due phobia enclosed spaces. ordered open mri kaiser would approve closed mri. thought production line health care system couldn\\\\t get better billing, went made worse. upcoming appointment tomorrow radiology. received call (while work) kaiser, representing caring nurse tell upcoming appointment. instead, asked deductible payment. run card today payment? wow. haven\\\\t even service yet, so... no! unacceptable completely disgusting. pay high enough premium, forced into, high deductible, work doesn\\\\t want spend money split high monthly costs. 5 years ago, heck even years ago, not issue. classic, kaiser... asking payment service days appointment. normally not reviews unless really great experience. however time, thought people deserve know terrible experience kaiser. last year health insurance humana hmo. humana informed us not plan colorado anymore. dont know happened. already december 2015, rush get replacement husband maintenance medication. tried enrolling website website not working well decided go ehealth marketplace. kaiser auto-drafting wifes checking account monthly premium. called end february cancel auto draft could start paying online accounts. not fan auto draft. told wifes information taken system go online make

took money card got declined grocery store... humiliating. think important people understand sham kaiser. use kaiser colorado employer. nightmare. never use them. employer uses - quit find another employer offers decent health coverage. lose doctor, lose pharmacy not allowed talk doctor offices staff. required talk call center employees assign kaiser doctor set appointment (call center employees actually ask medical issues - uh, really? disgusting). transferred southern california northern california. seems beyond ability cope with. took money premiums, informed not transferred. kaisers billing/payment process nightmare. surgery july 2015 receiving bills surgery slowly(!) next several months. one bill $190.99 came due august paid september. kept asking pay bill next several months kept sending payments. fees also assessed (all july 2015 surgery) kept sending payments. total payments made $1,557.08. kaiser worst automated phone system ever call. get test results back, call standard number everything take several prompts not get office want instead hour half hold time get get transferred office need results back. try online service get results back. forgot password instead resetting password immediately talked customer service. send new password 10 days house! received email password changed. m2016 dad suffering. dad contacted kaiser november 2015 submitted form

come homes leaving hospital take care since unable leave beds except go bathroom several days. fact, kaiser suggested pay someone look them. unable cook, clean, maintain way several days surgery. personal, albeit limited, experience friends sutter, blue cross systems, convalescence immediately leaving hospital included coverage. husband purchased kaiser permanente insurance work. seemed excellent coverage area around us rates reasonable. commercials tv convincing well it. got pregnant. started calling obgyns took kaiser, none took kaiser. see, werent given options plan signed up, assigned hmo, even though wasnt called hmo signed up. local doctors take ppo multi choice, nearest hmo doctor 60 miles away. thats hmo doctor, not obgyn. last night started bleeding, since hadnt able get obgyn yet, called nurse line. dont waste time get health insurance! doctors like robots. dont care - care paycheck. several times - cant wait till august change insurance. look reviews - theyre right!!! awful healthcare provider. makes sick pay service like this. company needs shut down!! dont waste time cause wasted enough mine! best doctors overall happy kaiser 7 children. husband parents

medically, wonderful. experience medical insurance kaiser horrific. worst experience ever. long time member kaiser. started new job last year, found company didnt offer kaiser permanente medical insurance. complicated medical history team doctors kaiser helpful, reluctant change providers. decided become member kaiser covered california not chose medical provider offered company. experience member kaiser covered california compared member kaiser cushy group policy large corporation huge. cannot complain enough administration website coordination departments billing. clearly, kaiser could care less making convenient members. examples: auto-pay still send paper bill no indication im auto-pay. tried sign auto-pay online would work. called help, told online sign-up debit card never worked properly even though reported multiple times. talked round way. received guide 2016 coverage changes no indication guide final revised copy. became extremely ill 2005. next 3-4 years saw perhaps 12-15

place fitting, took multiple phone calls kaiser 6 weeks get brace. patient kaiser, found difficult get appointments. kaiser continues advertise new patients, dont enough doctors patients have. wait 5 months eye exam. appointment made, doctors spend minimum 15 minutes patients, dont always make specific diagnosis. ive change doctors many times find one common sense. receiving test results, due medical jargon, results often difficult understand not fully explained - even contact extra help nurses supposed knowledgeable. one tell couldnt remember studied things long ago. applied health care benefits via healthcare.gov. not entitled credits high earner. searched several plans ensure family doctor ophthalmologist covered plan. search doctors, names came up. thought great. later made appts family doctors not part kaisers plans, scheduled appt see ophthalmologist first. kaiser made many billing errors 2015 want $2,600. im second grievance hopefully give 1/31/16 terminate me. covered
